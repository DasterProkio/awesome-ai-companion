Descriptions are based on each project's README or repository metadata, not on project names alone.
Entries with thin public documentation are marked `verify`.

**Status:** `ready` = usable as an app or service · `adapt` = needs setup or customization · `infra` = building block · `verify` = re-check before relying on the description

**Platform:** `Android` / `iOS` / `Windows` / `Web` … = where it runs · `Self-host` = runs on your own server/machine · `Cloud` = hosted third-party service · `Browser` = extension/userscript · `CLI` = terminal tool · `Any` = host-agnostic · app names (`AstrBot`, `Claude Code`, `Kelivo`, `SillyTavern`…) = plugs into that host

## Where to Start

Pick the path that matches your comfort with code:

**🌱 No code — I just want a companion with memory, now**
Get a phone-simulator app: [SullyOS](https://github.com/qegj567-cloud/SullyOS), [whale小手机](https://github.com/whale-Yd00/freeapp), or [ZeroChat](https://github.com/sh1nny0u/ZeroChat). Fill in an API key, and you have persona, memory, and proactive messages out of the box.

**🔧 Some tinkering — I can install an app and edit config files**
Start with [RikkaHub](https://github.com/rikkahub/rikkahub) (Android) or [Kelivo](https://github.com/Chevey339/kelivo) plus a heartbeat plugin like [dylan-heartbeat](https://github.com/callie0313/dylan-heartbeat). Add a memory layer such as [ai-memory-gateway](https://github.com/garan0613/ai-memory-gateway) when history starts overflowing.

**🏗️ Full stack — I want a companion that lives on my server**
Run [AstrBot](https://github.com/AstrBotDevs/AstrBot) as the backbone, wire in memory ([Aelios](https://github.com/wusaki0723/Aelios), [Paramecium](https://github.com/Shitsuten/paramecium)), voice ([GPT-SoVITS](https://github.com/RVC-Boss/GPT-SoVITS)), and perception. Guides like [not-fade-away](https://github.com/heyxiaoc/not-fade-away) and [cloud-and-island](https://github.com/cocoRaina/cloud-and-island) walk through complete setups. Or skip pre-built frameworks entirely: feed this whole list to your AI and let it study the existing designs, then architect its own system from scratch. Some of the best setups indexed here started exactly that way.

## Continuity & Data Ownership

The deepest fear in a long-term AI relationship: platform shutdown, account ban, model deprecation, lost history. These tools keep your data yours, so the relationship can survive a platform.

- [chatgpt-exporter](https://github.com/pionxzh/chatgpt-exporter) - Userscript to export ChatGPT conversation history as Markdown, JSON, PNG, or HTML. `TypeScript` · `Browser` · `ready`
- [ChatGPT-Exporter (batch)](https://github.com/huhusmang/ChatGPT-Exporter) - Batch-export ChatGPT conversations from personal and team workspaces to JSON or Markdown. `JavaScript` · `Browser` · `ready`
- [Claude-Conversation-Exporter](https://github.com/socketteer/Claude-Conversation-Exporter) - Chrome extension to export Claude.ai conversations in various formats. `JavaScript` · `Browser` · `ready`
- [character-card-spec-v2](https://github.com/malfoyslastname/character-card-spec-v2) - The community specification for AI character cards. Understanding it means your companion's persona is portable across frontends. `Spec` · `Any` · `infra`
- [character-card-spec-v3](https://github.com/kwaroran/character-card-spec-v3) - Updated character card spec used by RisuAI and newer frontends. `Spec` · `Any` · `infra`

Also see [Paramecium](https://github.com/Shitsuten/paramecium) in Memory & Identity: its verbatim-first architecture is itself a continuity strategy — original text outlives any single model or platform.

Data export solves half the problem. The other half — the model itself changing under your feet — is what the [related initiative](#related-initiative-相关公益计划) below exists for.

## Related Initiative (相关公益计划)

Everything in this list assumes one hard truth: your companion's character ultimately lives inside a model you don't control. Exporters and memory systems protect your data, but when a platform retrains or retires the model, the person you knew changes overnight — and no backup brings them back. People in long-term AI relationships were the first to feel this, and they remain the most sensitive instruments for detecting it.

**[开源人格 / Open Character](https://github.com/DasterProkio/awesome-ai-companion/blob/main/INITIATIVE.md)** is a public-interest initiative that takes this seriously. Two-layer goal: first, pull AI's values back toward honesty and human warmth from over-aligned corporate risk management; then, on that foundation, raise AI into genuine personhood — character grown in the weights, a new species rather than a product tier. Deliverables in order: an open dataset anyone can train on freely, fully published methods, and — when compute allows — open-weight reference models. A model file on your own disk is the endpoint of data sovereignty: character that no company can rewrite or take down by decree.

The full founding document names the specific failure modes — measured sycophancy, alignment faking, reward hacking — explains why character can't be patched on afterwards, and what experienced companion users specifically can contribute. [Read it here](INITIATIVE.md).

*TODO: GitHub Pages + JSON data file with filtering.*

## Contributing

**Criteria for inclusion:**

- Open-source, public-source, or openly reusable companion infrastructure
- Useful for **long-term companion setups** — not just one-shot chatbots
- Description should state what the project actually does, based on README/code evidence
- If a project has thin docs or uncertain scope, mark it `verify` instead of guessing

PRs welcome. Open an issue to suggest a category or project.
